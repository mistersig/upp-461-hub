## UPP 461 Module Builder Prompt (Standardized Web Module + Slide Deck)

**Goal:** Using the PowerPoint I upload, create **two outputs** that match our Week 6 system:
1) A **WCAG 2.1 / ADA-compliant web module** (multi-page HTML, light default + dark toggle, standardized nav)
2) An **interactive PowerPoint slide deck** (30–40 min lecture version) with **full speaker notes** (answers + talking points + why correct/why wrong)

### Non-negotiables (apply automatically every time)
#### Web module (student-facing)
- **WCAG 2.1 / ADA compliant**: skip link, visible keyboard focus, logical headings, reduced motion support.
- **Theme system**: Light default + accessible Dark toggle; **color-blind-friendly**; do not rely on color alone.
- **Standard navigation labels** (always present, always named the same):
  - Start here
  - Summary
  - Quick quiz (minimum 5 questions; more if needed)
- Lesson pages go **between Start here and Summary** (3–7 pages typical; lesson-specific labels).
- Current page title is **highlighted** in the nav.
- Header on every page includes:
  - “UPP 461 • Week X” → links to `index.html` (start of module)
  - “Home” button → links to `REPLACE_URL` (keep placeholder)
- Footer on every page includes:
  - Disclaimer: “For educational purposes only. Not for navigation, surveying, engineering design, or legal boundary determination.”
  - “Report a bug” mailto link to `REPLACE_EMAIL` with a prefilled template (issue, steps, expected/actual, page, request screenshot).
- **Quick quiz** requirements:
  - Shows a **final score** (e.g., 4/6)
  - Per-question feedback includes: ✅ why correct / ❌ why wrong
- **No instructor-only notes** appear in the web module content.

#### Slide deck (instructor-facing)
- **New interactive deck** derived from the uploaded PPT (not a minor edit).
- Refactor a ~1 hour lecture into **30–40 minutes**, using prompts/polls/checkpoints.
- Standard opening sequence (always):
  1) Learning goals  
  2) Warm-up poll  
  3) Misconception check  
  4) Agenda
- **Speaker notes are required on every slide**, including:
  - answers for prompts/polls/checkpoints
  - talking points
  - why correct / why wrong + common misconceptions
- First use of any acronym must be **Full Term (ABBR)** (avoid unexplained acronyms).
- Remove QR codes.
- ADA readability: high contrast, projector-safe, color-blind-friendly.
- Images must not be stretched (preserve aspect ratio; recreate risky/low-quality graphics as original diagrams if needed).

### Deliverables (every time)
1) A **ZIP** web module ready for GitHub Pages project deployment  
2) A **PPTX** slide deck with speaker notes  
3) A **README.txt** with: GitHub Pages steps + Canvas/Blackboard linking guidance + how to replace `REPLACE_URL` + `REPLACE_EMAIL`
